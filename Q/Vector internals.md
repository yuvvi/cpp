# Comparison: QVector vs. std::vector Memory Management


| Feature |	QVector |	std::vector |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Dynamic Allocation |	Yes |	Yes |
| Growth Strategy |	Exponential |	Exponential |
| Copy-on-Write |	Yes |	No |
| Implicit Sharing |	Yes |	No |
| Manual Reserve |	reserve(int) |	reserve(int) |
| Shrink Capacity |	squeeze() |	shrink_to_fit() |
| Thread Safety |	Implicitly shared |	No sharing |

## Conclusion
- QVector is optimized for Qt applications, especially in multi-threaded and GUI environments.
- Implicit sharing (COW) reduces unnecessary copies, making `QVector` more efficient than `std::vector` in many cases.
- To avoid unnecessary deep copies, pass `QVector` by const reference (`const QVector<int>&`).
